# Assignment Submission Application

###  Problem Statement
After the onset of the pandemic and an eternal lockdown, education systems find it difficult to ensure proper and fair academic development of students. Assignment submissions have become more of a copy-paste job rather than an honest process. When assignments are taken from a remote location, integrity of the system reduces automatically. We aim to solve this problem by implementing a simple, interactive application that enables teachers to post their assignments without worrying about plagiarism and copy-work.

### Installation

* Go to the directory you want to store the project in via cd command
* git clone https://github.com/abhijoshi2k/Assignment-Submission-VSIT-hackathon
* Open node.js command prompt
* Go to the directory where we cloned the repository
* npm install`
* npm run dev
* Open on http://locahost:portid/ (portid provided in NodeJS CMD)

###  Features of the Application
* A Registration and Login system for students and teachers with user authentication and encryption.
